  ' ToDo: Make the "PixelGameEngine" class compatible with .NET MAUI to ensure it can run on Windows, 
  '       Linux, Android, and iOS.
  '
  '       This porting task is really challenging for my part. The original code heavily depends 
  '       on the Windows API, and the engine supports OpenGL rendering. I'm considering using the 
  '       "SkiaSharp" library or the built-in "Microsoft.Maui.Graphics" namespace, in order to 
  '       achieve cross-platform compatibility.
  '
  '       Since the entire engine will be ported to .NET MAUI using VB.NET, all pixel-level drawing 
  '       functions need to be replaced with implementations using "Microsoft.Maui.Graphics" and/or 
  '       "SkiaSharp". However, I'm not very familiar with using these two libraries for pixel-level 
  '       drawing. After all, I plan to tackle this issue by the end of this year.
  '
  '       I'm working on this porting project all by myself for the moment. If you have any suggestions
  '       or guidance, please feel free to let me know. I'll update the progress on GitHub.
